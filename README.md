# Bike-Sales-Data
A small project that was a bit less involved but still needed some basic cleaning.
The only real issue I encountered was that there were two country listings for the United States (United States and USA)
With some basic cleaning, I was able to correct that make the data slightly more uniform.
I wanted to be able to represent the Profit vs. Revenue for the bike sales, despite there being some more data to work with.
